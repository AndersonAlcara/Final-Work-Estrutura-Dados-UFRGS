(Avaliacao:0.00) - Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .	
(Avaliacao:0.00) - At a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism American moviemaking ever had , Godfrey Reggio 's career shines like a lonely beacon .

(Avaliacao:0.00) - Robert Harmon 's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in - the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film 's thick shadows .	
(Avaliacao:-0.70) - This movie may not have the highest production values you 've ever seen , but it 's the work of an artist , one whose view of America , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep .	
(Avaliacao:0.00) - Feral and uncomfortable .	
(Avaliacao:5.50) - Sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first -LRB- as best I remember -RRB- , but still a very good time at the cinema .	
(Avaliacao:1.70) - It 's more enjoyable than I expected , though , and that 's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs .	
(Avaliacao:0.00) - Black-and-white and unrealistic .	
(Avaliacao:2.70) - The film is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol .	
(Avaliacao:-1.20) - The only camouflage Carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers .	
(Avaliacao:0.00) - Not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense .	
(Avaliacao:1.60) - Some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .

(Avaliacao:1.00) - The increasingly diverse French director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history .	
(Avaliacao:2.70) - One of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature .

(Avaliacao:0.00) - Halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles .	
(Avaliacao:0.40) - Witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy .	
(Avaliacao:-1.20) - One senses in World Traveler and in his earlier film that Freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .

(Avaliacao:0.00) - To the filmmakers , Ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit .	
(Avaliacao:0.00) - Using a stock plot , About a Boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater .	
(Avaliacao:0.30) - Beating the Austin Powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness .

(Avaliacao:1.90) - Except it 's much , much better .

(Avaliacao:0.00) - Sadly , ` Garth ' has n't progressed as nicely as ` Wayne . '	
(Avaliacao:0.00) - With wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters ' striving solipsism .	
(Avaliacao:0.00) - It labours as storytelling .	
(Avaliacao:0.00) - Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ?

(Avaliacao:-3.10) - If the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic Heaven will quite likely be more like hell .	
(Avaliacao:0.00) - It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .
